        <p className="mb-4">
          Hi, I’m <span className="font-semibold">Margaret Ajibola</span>, a Computer Engineering graduate and
          full-stack developer passionate about building modern, scalable web
          applications and intuitive user experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My background includes hands-on experience with web development,
          automation testing, API validation, and CI/CD workflows. I’ve worked
          with technologies like <span className="font-medium">Next.js, TypeScript, React, Playwright, and Node.js</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m driven by curiosity and problem-solving — always learning and
          improving how I design, test, and deliver high-quality applications.
